# GitHub Webhook Server

This Node.js server acts as a GitHub webhook handler, automating actions based on push events triggered in specific branches of your repositories. The server is designed to handle various repositories and their associated Dockerized applications.

### But... Why?

I was trying to automate some CI/CD processes. I wanted to understand webhooks. And when I understood that in the end, for Github, it's about sending a payload to a webhook once an action triggers it, I thought this would be great to work from anywhere to do real continuous deployement!

My idea is to configure the repositories.json file with my profiles. Of course, right now, this works only if all my workflows are on the same servers (which they are for now). It does help me speed up my development workflow. The current workflow that works:

1. I work on any machine code that is git-enabled
2. I commit my work
3. I do a pull request, commit & merge
4. Github invokes a webhook on my endpoint
5. Server receives the payload, validates it's a push on a specific branch
6. If it is, it pulls the code from the branch
7. It runs a docker-compose file that rebuilds the solution
8. Et voil√†! My app is up to date live on the server.

There's probably easier ways to do it, but I wanted to be able to make this work by myself to understand what happens. I also wanted to do this on my local server, which is on a dynamic host (DDNS). 

And it works.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your GitHub webhook secret.
    - Modify `repositories.json` to include your repository configurations.

4. **Start the Webhook Server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

### Usage

1. **Adding Repositories:**
    - Update `repositories.json` to include repository details like `secretEnvName`, `path`, `webhookPath`, and `composeFile`.

2. **GitHub Webhook Configuration:**
    - Set up a GitHub webhook for your repositories with the payload URL pointing to your server's endpoint (`http://your-domain.com/webhook`).

3. **GitHub Event Filtering:**
    - The server processes push events only from specified branches (`refs/heads/<branch-name>`), triggering actions for successful pushes.

4. **Actions Performed:**
    - Upon receiving valid push events, the server executes `git pull` on the specified branch and rebuilds Docker containers using `docker-compose`.

### Repository Configuration

- **`repositories.json`:**
  - Define multiple repositories with their respective configurations.
  - Ensure `secretEnvName`, `path`, `webhookPath`, and `composeFile` are accurately set.

### Dependencies

- **Express:** Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **Body Parser:** Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- **Child Process:** For executing shell commands.
- **Crypto:** Utilized for signature verification.
- **Dockerode:** Library for interacting with the Docker API.

### Notes

- Ensure proper security measures:
  - Protect `.env` file containing sensitive information.
  - Review and secure your server and webhook configurations.
